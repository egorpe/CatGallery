Cat Gallery
===========
As it was not requested specifically, I didn't make it responsive so the layout is fixed width and uses default fonts with very little "beatification" (as it was said in the spec sheet, it is not the point of the exercise).

I'd simply use Twitter Bootstrap but I feel like it was prohibited by the requirements.
